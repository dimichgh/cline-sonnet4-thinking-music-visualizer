## Technical Implementation

### Core Components
```typescript
interface DigitalEarthConfig {
  earthRadius: number;
  subdivisions: number;
  pulseIntensity: number;
  moonDistance: number;
  orbitSpeed: number;
}

class ElectricalSystem {
  generatePulse(intensity: number, frequency: number): void;
  updateArcs(deltaTime: number): void;
  connectVertices(vertex1: Vector3, vertex2: Vector3): void;
}

class DataStreamSystem {
  createParticleStream(count: number): void;
  updateFlow(speed: number): void;
  addDataPackets(): void;
}
```

### Audio Mapping Strategy
- **Low frequencies (20-250Hz)**: Deep Earth core pulses
- **Mid frequencies (250-4000Hz)**: Surface electrical activity
- **High frequencies (4000-20000Hz)**: Atmospheric data streams
- **Beat detection**: Major pulse events
- **Spectral centroid**: Overall visualization energy

## Visual Effects
- Neon blue/cyan wireframe with electric glow
- Pulsing electrical arcs between vertices
- Flowing particle streams in orbital paths
- Dynamic color shifts based on audio content
- Holographic data overlays

## Performance Considerations
- Use instanced rendering for particle systems
- Optimize geometry complexity based on performance
- Implement LOD system for distant elements
- Cache frequently used calculations

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for geometry generation
- Performance benchmarks for particle systems
- Visual regression tests for effects
- Audio synchronization validation

## Success Criteria
- Smooth 60fps performance with complex effects
- Responsive audio synchronization
- Visually compelling cyberpunk aesthetic
- Stable particle system performance
- Accurate orbital mechanics
