## Technology Stack
- **Platform**: Electron with TypeScript
- **Graphics**: Three.js, WebGL, Custom Shaders
- **Audio**: Web Audio API, AudioWorklet
- **Testing**: Mocha, Sinon, Chai
- **Physics**: Custom implementations

## Next Action
Implement memory-efficient Digital Earth Visualizer with simplified geometry

## Phase 4 Progress & Memory Optimization
üîç **Issue Identified**: Memory constraints with complex 3D visualizations
- **Root Cause**: Three.js with complex geometries causes V8 OOM (~4GB memory usage)
- **Impact**: App crashes during visualization initialization
- **Solution**: Simplified geometry approach with optimized rendering

**Memory Testing Results**:
‚úÖ Core app runs successfully without 3D visualization  
‚úÖ Audio engine and analysis systems work properly  
‚ùå Three.js visualization system causes OOM  
‚ùå Complex geodesic spheres with electrical arcs exceed memory limits  

**Optimization Strategy**:
1. Use basic geometries (low-poly spheres instead of geodesic)
2. Limit concurrent dynamic objects (electrical arcs, particles)
3. Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed elements
4. Use instanced rendering where possible
5. Progressive complexity loading based on performance

## Phase 3 Achievements
‚úÖ **Visualization Framework Complete**
- Created comprehensive Three.js-based visualization system
- Implemented VisualizationManager with mode switching
- Built SceneManager for WebGL rendering pipeline
- Created BaseVisualizationMode abstract class
- Developed four placeholder visualization modes:
  - PsychedelicMode: Audio-reactive rotating cube with color changes
  - DigitalEarthMode: Wireframe sphere with electrical grid effects
  - BlackHoleMode: Dark center with rotating accretion disk
  - TronCityMode: Neon grid with racing light cycle
- Integrated with AudioEngine for real-time audio analysis data
- Added performance monitoring and error handling
- Connected to main application with keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1-4)

The visualization framework provides rich, real-time analysis data perfect for driving the four cosmic visualization modes through:
- **Psychedelic**: Spectral features and instrument presence for ethereal effects
- **Digital Earth**: Frequency bands for electrical pulse triggers  
- **Black Hole**: Volume dynamics for gravitational wave patterns
- **Tron City**: Beat synchronization for light cycle racing
